## 1. Code
 ```c
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int freq[10];

int main(void){
	// enter the input
	string input;
	cin.tie(0);
	cin >> input;

	// frequency of 0 to 10 in 'freq'
	for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); i++) {
		int idx = input[i] - '0';
		freq[idx]++;
	}

	int result = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		if (i != 6 && i != 9) {
			if (result < freq[i]) {
				result = freq[i];
			}
		}
		else {
			if (result <(freq[6] + freq[9] + 1) / 2) {
				result = (freq[6] + freq[9] + 1) / 2;
			}
		}
	}

	cout << result;
}
 ```

## 2. output
```c
//input
9999

//output
2
```

## 3. Approach
### Pseudo code
```
procedure MinimunSet{
    input := string from user
    freq := array of frequency of 0 to 10

    // string to integer
    for i:=0 to input.size()
        idx := input[i] - '0'
        freq[idx]++
    
    result := 0
    for i:=0 to 9
        if i != 6 and i != 9 :
            if result < freq[i]:
                result := freq[i]
        else:
            if result < (freq[6] + freq[9] + 1) / 2 :
                result = (freq[6] + freq[9] + 1) / 2

    return result
}
```

### Explanation for Psuedo code
**how to approach**   
First, the character string inputted from the user is stored in `input`. Then, characters are converted into integers through ASCII operation.   

`freq` is an integer array from 0 to 9. Write in `freq` how many integers from 0 to 9 exist in the input value.   

Since 6 and 9 are the same in the question, record the highest frequency in 
`result` except for when i is 6 and 9. If i is 6 or 9, if the sum of the quotient and the remainder (=`k`) of 2 is greater than the result, update the result to `k`.

***

## 4. Analysis
### Correctness
When i is 6 or 9, the quotient obtained by dividing `(the number of 6 + the number of 9 + 1)` by 2 is called `k`. Compare with k and result. At this time, if `result<k`, result is updated to `k`, so the condition that `6 and 9 are interchangeable with each other` in the problem can be satisfied.

### Performance
This time complexity has `O(n)`.

## 5. Future Work
There are no more better codes, then you don't need to write this.
